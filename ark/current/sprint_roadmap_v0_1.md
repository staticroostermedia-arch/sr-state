# Sprint Roadmap v0.1 (parcel)

Cadence: 2-hour beats. Each sprint yields a drop with receipts.

1) Forge v0.1.4 — auto emit chain, lint, checkpoint; show seal and lateness.
2) Runner receipts — sr.done_receipt.v0_1 implemented; sample flow + viewer.
3) AI Bridge API v0.1 — JSON contract for plan/receipt/artifact exchange.
4) Skeleton Hub/Registry — minimal index of tools, configs, and site state.
5) Field Post Map micro-view — render relative map from last batch, annotate.
6) Penitential & Fixlist automation — auto-generate rename/move commands.
