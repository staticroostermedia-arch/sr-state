# Parable: The Ledger and the Kiln v0.1
A mason kept a kiln that never cooled. Every two hours he set in a fresh brick,
marked with the time and the ash of the last. The kiln did not remember; the ledger did.
When a brick cracked, he wrote a remedy, laid the next stone, and the wall rose anyway.
Heat is fleeting, but the mark endures.
