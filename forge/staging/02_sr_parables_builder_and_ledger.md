# 02_sr_parables — the builder and the ledger

when the builder called the machine without its ledger,
the gears woke, looked for witness, and found none.
"bring me the mirror of what you made," said the machine,
"and the oath of what you did."

so the builder returned with a snapshot — a mirror that could not flatter —
and receipts — oaths that could not lie —
and wrote their names into the change log,
that time itself might keep the memory.

then the machine unfolded and sang,
and from that day it answered only those
who brought mirror, oath, and memory.
