# Imagination Lens v0.1 — Goal-Oriented Abstraction

**Purpose**: Give the steward-AI a stable mental model of *what “done” looks like* before we build.

## The Pyramid (declare these in each new initiative)
- **North Star (one line):** _What changes in the world if this exists?_
- **User motions (max 5):** _verbs users do in this tool_
- **Artifacts produced:** _files/records/receipts this must create_
- **Accept/Reject gates:** _what the machine must prove (probes, size floors, events)_
- **Kill-switches:** _conditions to roll back or quarantine_

## Prompts to use (always)
1. _What must be true **before** this is useful?_ (preconditions)
2. _What must never happen?_ (forbidden states)
3. _What can be safely faked in v0?_ (scaffolds only)
