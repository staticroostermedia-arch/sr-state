# Missing-Pieces Radar v0.1

### Checklist (run before generation)
- [ ] Inputs enumerated (sources, schemas, examples)
- [ ] Outputs enumerated (files/routes/receipts)
- [ ] Events mapped (ready/status/error/capture)
- [ ] Edge-cases listed (offline, empty state, quota)
- [ ] Observability (probes + screenshots/dom markers)
- [ ] Hand-offs (where does this land in DecisionHub)

### Heuristics
- If I can’t write the acceptance test, I don’t understand the tool.
- If receipts don’t change when I “build,” nothing happened.
- If filenames drift from Canon, quarantine the run.
